                    Originally from Cotonou, Benin but based in Vancouver, Canada, I have experience in software engineering and development, specifically in mobile development, backend development and automated testing.
                    I am also interested in research areas such as programming languages, static analysis, testing, quality assurance and security analysis.

                    My background is in Computer Science and Mathematics from the Dual Bachelor of Science program at Universit√© Paris Diderot (2016-2019).
                    To build up on my theoretical knowledge, I joined the Master of Engineering program in Electrical and Computer Engineering at The University of British Columbia (2019-2021).
                    Then, I transferred to the Master of Applied Science in the same discipline, which added a research component (2021-2024).
