A detailed investigation of challenges faced not only by tools, but surprisingly also by human testers to explore commercial applications. How can we break the 30% coverage curse? You can check the full investigation, selected apps and tools, identified patterns and recommendations for app analysts in this [Master's thesis](https://open.library.ubc.ca/soa/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1. 0440710).
