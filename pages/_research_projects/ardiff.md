Refactored some of your code and now it doesn't work as it used too? Use this open-source formal equivalence checker for Java programs on both version of your codes to check if they're still the same, without needing to run anything! Check out the [FSE paper](https://people.ece.ubc.ca/~mjulia/publications/ARDiff_2020.pdf) for this tool. Also, got awarded the ACM SIGSOFT CAPS and Travel Grant to present this work at ESEC/FSE 2022.
