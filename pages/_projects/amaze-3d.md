<!-- TODO ADD DEMO AFTER CLEANUP AND GETTING CODE TO RUN -->
Get immersed in this 3D labyrinth game in solo or compete with your friends in multiplayer mode, using randomly generated mazes or your own. 
Not the most eye-catching project but you can chose your difficulty level, beware of monsters or other surprises and have fun :)
